													<h3>Composer's Memo</h3>
												</header>
												<p>After experiencing my own personal use of social media in education, I was inspired to write an argumentative essay on the topic. I’ve heard a lot about classrooms including AI and other new technologies in the classroom, but I hadn't heard a lot about the inclusion of social media. I remembered that throughout high school, the teachers villainized social media, but I wanted to explore the potential benefits of it and how we could use it more responsibly. 
												</p>

												<p>My primary audience is the school boards and instructors because they have the power to establish new rules. I started the project thinking that I'd write an academic paper to convey my argument because proposals for new laws must be quite formal with several pieces of statistical evidence, but then I was made aware of a secondary audience that I should consider: other students. A formal academic paper wouldn't easily allow other students to read my argument and provide feedback. Gaining support from fellow peers would only strengthen my argument because the school boards and instructors would realize how many students are in support for combining social media and education. So, I transitioned into using an open letter format to target the school boards and instructors and students. Open letters are the perfect balance between formally presenting information and engaging readers with images, font sizes, and more. 
												</p> 
												<p>To balance my primary and secondary audiences, I broke a couple conventions of letters. I never directly referred to my primary audience except for the introduction to avoid completely isolating my secondary audience. Additionally, I included several graphs, which typically wouldn’t be included in a letter, but the graphs help reinforce my argument because the brain usually digests pictures better than words. At the same time, though, there were several features of an open letter that I used to further my argument. I included several hyperlinks to sources that supported what I stated, and I defined clear sections of my letter by playing around with font sizes and weight. Not only does my letter alone convey a formal but engaging tone, but the website that I created to post my letter on does too. I made sure to have a sleek and professional website design without making it look too intimidating. Since letters are a bit more personal than academic research papers, I decided to incorporate my own stories as evidence to prove that the benefits of social media in education isn’t limited to just statistics on paper, but it also extends to actual students’ lives. </p>
												<p>For my first draft of my letter, I only had text because the open letter examples that I saw had no pictures. But after considering my multiple audiences, I realized that if my project was only text, I'd cut off most of my secondary audience. While students my age do read several articles and resources that are just big blocks of text, very rarely do we do it voluntarily. Images help keep us engaged and wanting to continue reading. I believe that my project is much stronger with graphs to support my argument. I limited the various modes used in my project to images and text because I want readers to focus on the content in my letter and not feel overwhelmed. Thus, I avoided including music to play in the background as people read my letter. Adding sound might cause the reader to lose focus of my words and not truly understand my argument.</p>
												<p>The structure of my essay changed quite a bit throughout the development process. For the first version, I had a section for just addressing counterarguments, and I used more casual language and focused only on stating the impacts of social media in education without mentioning why such impacts were important. Through feedback, I realized that reformatting would be vital for an effective argument. Since I chose to cover a topic more on the controversial side, I decided to follow my peer’s feedback to address counterarguments throughout my essay rather than in just one section, so readers wouldn’t be invested with arguments against my points while reading through my letter. I also became aware of my lack of focus on targeting my letter to my primary audience. I spent too much effort trying to balance my two audiences, so my primary audience became fuzzy. As a solution, I edited my letter to use more formal language to clearly divide who my primary and secondary audiences are. My final change was explaining more about why the positive impacts that social media has on education and students matter. One of my peers pointed out that they understood the positive aspects that I brought up, but didn’t see the importance. So, in my arguments, I dug deeper into why the benefits matter.</p>
												<p>If I were to do the draft process again, I would try to be grander with my decisions. I initially wanted to keep my final project in a Google Doc, but after seeing several of my peers using Wix to build themselves a website to post their project on, I was thoroughly impressed. Their drafts felt completely different from mine, despite many of them using the same genre as me, so I believe it was due to the design and layout of the whole website. I switched to a website layout quite late in the process, so I didn’t have as much time to consider more website layouts and explore the several features of Wix. As a consequence, I couldn’t take advantage of color as I did in the Google Docs version because I was unfamiliar with the resource. I would've also added a process where I established a more thorough outline. I realized that my flow was a bit unorganized, while several of my peers had a clear flow throughout their outline. So, if I spent more time with the planning and organization, the transition to my final project would have been much smoother. For the path that I did pursue, though, I am proud of the final version of my project.
