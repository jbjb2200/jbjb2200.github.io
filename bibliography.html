												<p>Crash Course. “Social Media: Crash Course Navigating Digital Information #10.” YouTube, 
													YouTube, 12 Mar. 2019, www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5YKW6fhlss. Accessed 3 Nov. 
													2020. <br><br>
													This video is one of my non-traditional resources, and the Crash Course channel is 
													renowned for their educational videos written by experts in the fields related to the video topics. Posted just a year ago, this video should have mostly current information. This video discusses the impact social media has had on our lives online and offline. John Green, the face of the Crash Course channel, provides examples of how social media and technology have led to the birth of new vocabulary and how fake online accounts led to large offline events. Fortunately, the video isn’t biased regarding if social media is bad or good because it presents the pros of social media, like accessibility to share individual thoughts, and cons, like the ease to spread false information. I plan to use this resource near the introduction of my letter to give more context for how social media is already deeply integrated into our lives. The stories brought up about the connection between social media online and offline could act as an effective hook. I also intend to use this resource when talking about the negative side of social media because it explains tactics regarding how to carefully analyze information found online for falsehood, which will help solve potential counter arguments.

													<p>Gupta, Madhu, et al. “Social Media in Education: Bane or Boon.” Scholarly Research Journal 
														For Interdisciplinary Studies, II/VIII, 2013, pp. 170–181, https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kiran_Rani5/publication/331701444_SOCIAL_MEDIA_IN_EDUCATION_BANE_OR_BOON/links/5c887c77a6fdcc38174fa374/SOCIAL-MEDIA-IN-EDUCATION-BANE-OR-BOON.pdf. Accessed 3 Nov. 2020.<br><br> This article carries credibility, for it is from an international peer reviewed journal, and the main author Madhu Gupta is a professor who teaches education. This article begins by examining the most popular social media sites and their advantages and purposes. Additionally, the article talks about a few studies about how instructors interact with social media, like how many instructors know how to use social media, and how students react to social media in education, like their relationship with instructors. The numerical evidence will certainly help prove my argument. Despite the author being from India, Gupta references studies conducted in the United States, so the data and evidence in the article still fit into my geographical scope. A possible drawback is when this article was published. 7 years ago is still within the 10 year limit, but considering how fast social media transforms, some information might not be relevant anymore. The article balances between the positive and negative aspects of social media, so I believe that I want to use this resource when acknowledging counter arguments and defending my argument.

														<p>Magette, Kristin. “Teachers Talk About Using Social Media.” Educational Horizons, vol. 92, no. 
															2, 2013, pp. 6–7. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/42927213. Accessed 3 Nov. 2020.<br><br> This 
															resource reports about teachers from elementary, middle, and high schools talking about how they use social media in the classroom and the effects, and the author Kristin Magette is a reputable, award-winning advocate for strategic communications. I limited my argument to high school and college students, but this resource could open my eyes to the advantages of social media use in elementary and middle school. Teachers for younger grades focused on using social media to mostly communicate with parents and didn’t involve students. Teachers for older students also provided updates to parents, but they began allowing students to involve social media in their assignments, like posting videos or Facebook posts. This article was published in 2013, though, so there is a long time for teachers’ opinions to change and social media to transform. Another worry for using this resource is that I don’t know the exact questions that were asked to the teachers, so I can’t judge how biased this resource is. But this article is especially useful because I can reference the exact words from teachers about their experiences with social media in the classroom. This will add to my anecdotal evidence for my thesis and expand on how education could be transformed into another form of entertainment.

														https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/social-media-in-the-classroom-why-does-it-matter/id655724412?i=1000160215681. Accessed 3 Nov. 2020.<br><br> This is my other non-traditional resource and it’s a podcast made for the American Military University and hosted by Tee Morris, who is a writer with a focus in technology. This podcast is about using social media for its intended purpose of improving communication, but particularly among students and teachers. Morris mentions how easy it is to connect with teachers in a less strict and formal setting through social media. He also brings up another important point about how social media provides a platform for students to exchange ideas. In such a complex world that we’re in today, it’s important to have varying perspectives and keep an open mind, and Morris states that social media allows this. Students have the ability to talk to other students from all over the world and get recommended varying resources to use. I plan to use this resource to elaborate on how social media in education leads to students considering more than one perspective, broadening their world view. This resource is definitely biased to using social media in education, for Morris barely acknowledged the drawbacks of it. There is no date for when this resource was posted, but the information he talked about still seemed relevant.

														<p>Nantais, Michael. “Creating An Empowering School Environment.” Hybrid Pedagogy, Hybrid 
															Pedagogy, 2 Feb. 2016, https://hybridpedagogy.org/creating-empowering-school-environment/.  Accessed 3 Nov. 2020.
															<br><br> This article introduced me to the topic of social media in education, and it will most likely be the core resource I use, and the author of this article Michael Nantais has much knowledge in this topic area because his particular interest in educational technology is the connection between education and social media. Nantais limits the age group to high school, which fits perfectly into my chosen age range. The most valuable part of this article is Nantais’s explanation, analysis, and review of a study he did while observing teachers using social media in their classrooms for six months. He heard from the teachers that they developed closer relationships with their students, even connecting with students that usually never talked with them. A more stable relationship between teachers and students emerged as well because allowing social media use meant that the students were trusted. However, Nantais also focused on the risks of including social media in school, for it could be very distracting and harder to control. The mostly unbiased approach Nantais takes for this topic convinces me that this article is worth using in my essay. Additionally, this article was published only 4 years ago. This resource will support my argument that tying social media and education together will lead to more comfortable relationships between students and instructors, thus improving learning.

														Higher Education.” Student Engagement and Experience Journal, vol. 5, no. 1, 2016, http://shura.shu.ac.uk/id/eprint/12274. Accessed 3 Nov. 2020. <br><br> This article was written for a journal most likely read by instructors looking to engage students, and Alison Purvis, the main author of this article, is the College Head of Learning, Teaching, and Assessment at Sheffield Hallam University. The article addresses if social media is really effective in classrooms or not. Purvis first talks about the communities formed on social media before tackling several reasons why social media is not a good idea in the classroom. She discusses a couple reasons, like social media being a distraction, but she also mentions stats and studies either disproving the previous reasons she brought up or introducing an advantage to social media in the classroom. This resource will be valuable when addressing opponents to my argument because I will have concrete evidence to counter several of their points. Another bonus of this article is that it was published recently, meaning that the information is still relevant.

Accessed 3 Nov. 2020.<br><br> This article was written for graduate studies and the main author Qingya Wang has his Master of Business Administration. Though he doesn’t have much many credentials related specifically to social media, technology, or education, his own experience as a college student could’ve helped him through this research article. Throughout this resource, Wang writes about a sample of college students where they filled out a questionnaire about the impact of social media in their lives. Wang analyzed the most popular social media platforms and how much social media distracts students and impacts grades. This data is from 2011, though, so the statistics given by the study is most likely not applicable to today. The purpose for this article in my letter is to provide some context for how integrated social media is in our lives. I plan to pair information from this resource with information from the Crash Course video. I could emphasize this point by discussing how many college students used social media in just 2011 with the assumption that the numbers rose since then.
