													<h3>Spiderverse</h3>
												</header>
												<p>To celebrate finishing a week of 3 midterms, I wanted the Netflix movie Over the Moon with my mother. I just wanted a movie to watch, so I picked this movie at random, but little did I know that it’d be a beautiful tale of a Chinese-American girl building a rocket to meet the moon goddess Chang’e. Chang’e was the wife of Houyi, who was the archer who shot down nine of the ten suns. She drank an elixir that made her immortal, so she floated to the moon, waiting for Houyi to eventually join her. Despite not knowing anything about animation and professional drawing, I’ve been obsessed with the creation of the animated movie Spiderman: Into the Spiderverse. I watched the movie for the first time earlier this year, and since then, I’ve been addicted to rewatching the movie because the production team put in so much care into the movie that I can focus on something new for each rewatch. The first time I watched it, I was just stunned by the animation, colors, music, and story. Then, I focused solely on particular parts of the movie.</p>

													<p>Besides just watching the movie multiple times, I watched several behind the scene videos. Through those videos, I learned how the animators played around with frame rates to portray how novice the protagonist was in the beginning, but learned how to become Spiderman by the end. The animators also avoided using motion blur, so at any second, the movie looks like a comic book page. There were details in the shading and lighting too, for the animators used hatching and Ben Day dots for both. Surprisingly, the animators included machine learning to draw 2D lines on top of their 3D models for more expressive faces. I love the innovation and boundaries they pushed in the medium. All of the attention to the smallest of details reminded me a lot of multimodal composition. When composing a multimodal piece, one must carefully consider their audience and how to most effectively convey their message. Similarly, the animators of Spiderman: Into the Spiderverse knew that their main audience was comic book fans, so they did as much as they could to make the movie like a comic book. This is the kind of attention to details that I want to include in my final project for ENGL 182.
