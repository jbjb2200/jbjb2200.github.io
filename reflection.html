													<h3>Introduction</h3>
												</header>
												<p>For my portfolio, I wanted the audience to be able to easily access all of my works from this quarter while also getting a sense of my personality. I settled on a website because not only is it an organized way of displaying my work how I want it to be presented, but I could also customize it and integrate a bit of me into the design and layout. Due to the personalizable aspect of the site being an important part of why I chose such a platform for my portfolio, I settled on using an HTML website template instead of a drag and drop template. From my experience with Wix for my MP1 project, I discovered that Wix limits a lot of the creative ideas that I wanted to include in the site. However, I admit that I didn’t spend enough time exploring the various drag and drop templates available on Wix and other sites. An HTML template takes a lot more effort and time to work with, but I believe that the more personalizable aspect of it makes it worth it. I view portfolios as a place to showcase one’s work and oneself, so I integrated my adoration of cats in my website. The cats act as a little piece of me in the portfolio, and it’s an aspect of the website to make viewers remember it. 
												</p>

												<p>The portfolio mostly embodies Outcome 1 and Outcome 4. I chose to do a website because I wanted my audience to easily navigate through my portfolio. Since I didn’t want to cause visitors on my website any confusion, I focused on being consistent with my color choices, layouts, and naming schemes. At the same time, I was open to suggestions and revisions for my portfolio site. I gained several insights of how my website could be improved from the portfolio examples from the past, and decided to include a theme tying everything together. Portfolios that revealed the creator’s interests and hobbies and used them as a unifying connection between the showcased pieces and reflection stood out to me immediately. Accordingly, I revised my earlier website to include connections to cats, which are my favorite animals. I soon discovered that making this change helped me decide on images, a color palette, and how to layout my growth in English 182.

											<h3>My English 182 Journey</h3>
										</header>
										<p>While making my portfolio and looking over my earlier projects in the quarter, I couldn’t believe how differently I view various modes now. I’ve shifted my writing and composition style away from focusing on only my argument to also sincerely considering how to reach out to my intended audience. At the beginning of the quarter, the scope of my experience with English assignments was limited to long analytical essays and formal academic writing. Like a baby kitten with little social interaction and no knowledge of other cats other than their mother, I only knew how to write papers on literature. Having only one writing style was severely hampering the various kinds of people who I could reach out to, though. I realized in a world that was becoming more aware of the importance of diversity and accessibility, I needed to grow as a writer and composer too. Thus, I entered the early socialization stage of cats. </p>
										<p>Like cats in this stage, I began exploring ways to create an argument besides a formal paper. SA2 was the first assignment that required me to carefully plan how I wanted to combine different modes. Before starting, all I knew was that I wanted to express my creativity through the assignments, but I didn’t realize that I would also learn how to effectively include the audience into my work. I chose to write a letter about an artifact from the boy group BTS, and I directed the letter to people who irrationally despised the group. With an audience in mind, I found myself contemplating the platform, writing style, and more for my letter. The multimodal composition decisions that I made all derived from how I wanted to reach my target audience. I had never put so much effort into thinking about the mannerisms and behaviors of an audience and tailoring my work to them, but I realized that I could only come up with the idea of putting my letter on social media by focusing on my audience. Initially, the idea to use social media never entered my mind, but I wanted to find a platform where information spreads fast and many regular people use it, and social media, specifically Twitter, fit the bill. However, due to being in a learning stage, I struggled to truly take advantage of the platform that I chose. I was too stuck in the formal writing mode, and left out key features of Twitter, like hashtags, from my letter. Also, my Twitter thread read more like a typical written letter rather than a thread on a social media platform. I believe that after focusing so much on how to convey my message to my audience, I forgot to include what makes each platform unique into my work. 
										</p>
										<p>Acknowledging the mistakes that I made in SA2, I became interested in exploring more modes that I couldn’t before in English classes. Similar to a cat vigorously exploring in the late socialization phase of their development, I attempted a vlog styled video for SA3. Taking the skills that I learned from SA2 about composing for the audience, I wanted to treat my classmates as friends who I was introducing my living room to. If people say images are worth a thousand words, then videos are worth tens of thousands of words. With a video, not only could I treat the audience as companions, but I could also show where all the items and furniture are relative to each other in my living room. This was important for when I explained the balanced layout of the room. Additionally, the viewer could feel like they were walking around in my living room, which is a completely different feeling from just viewing pictures. In SA3, I believe that I demonstrated a strong understanding of who my audience was and used the features that make videos unique to strengthen the analysis of my living room space. 
										</p>
										<p>Around the start of MP1, I felt a little less motivated to try new modes, which marked the start of the resemblance of my phase as a multimodal composer and the adolescence phase of the development of cats. While cats become a little less social, my ideas for multimodal compositions dwindled. My SA4 and SA5 felt like my most uninspired and weakest pieces from this quarter because I didn’t include any multimodal elements, and I didn’t incorporate the skills that I gained from the previous projects. I disliked how I rushed the proposal and the process of finding sources and analyzing them. As I realized from the other assignments, a huge part of a project is the careful planning, but I failed to apply as much care in SA4 and SA5 as I would have liked to. 
										</p>
										<p>Once I reached the actual MP1 project, I became excited again to combine different modes. I was in the prime of the quarter and had an abundant amount of knowledge related to multimodal composition in my toolbox. Much of my project was driven by taking feedback and coming up with ways to improve my work. My first version of the project was going to be a formal academic paper directed solely towards the school boards and instructors, but my first piece of feedback was regarding how I’d also spread my message to other students. Demonstrating flexibility, I shifted from a formal academic paper to an open letter format. Then, I could retain the formalness for my primary audience and include images to attract other students. I could be confident in making this change because I had tried out and looked at several examples of multimodal compositions for previous projects and examined their strengths and weaknesses. Having the experience of composing for the audience in previous projects also strengthened my foundation for the final project. My MP1 did end up being hurt by the lack of more careful planning. This is an area where I intend to improve for future college assignments, for this weakness led to a more choppier flow and not as many multimodal aspects as I would have liked in my final project. I am proud, though, of how I acknowledged contrasting perspectives of my argument throughout my letter, and I hope to keep honing this strength. 
										</p>
										<p>This class may end soon, but how I apply what I learned in this class will never stop. I will mostly take away the importance of understanding my audience and the platform that I’m using. Both play a significant role in shaping how I successfully convey my message to others. Already in my other classes, I catch myself pondering the impact on a large or small audience of how I format images and text together. As someone interested in participating in research in the future, I intend to certainly use what I learned from multimodal composition when including videos, images, sound, and more into research papers.</p>
