													<h3>Week One Introduction</h3>
												</header>
												<p>Hello! My name is Jessica Burroughs (she/her/hers), and I'm a freshman majoring in Computer Science. I'm hoping to also get a B.S. in Economics. I live in Yelm, Washington, which is a one hour and thirty minute drive to Seattle without bad traffic, so I have about a tourist-level familiarity with the large city. I'm always open to touring Seattle with other people after quarantine lifts. For this quarter, I'm staying home.</p>

												<p>Currently, I love most topics related to CS, so I don't know what I want to do specifically as a job. My goal is to spend time in college exploring the different paths that I can do. I'm slightly leaning towards data science, for I'm involved in a small non-profit organization called Mind My Mind where I enjoy visualizing data that shows the impact of COVID-19 on mental health.</p> 
												
												<p>In my free time, I love drawing characters on my phone, reading psychology books, pretending to be a professional nature photographer, and watching movies. I have a particular soft spot for animated movies with entrancing music, such as "The Prince of Egypt" and "Anastasia."  On a related note, music is everything to me. I constantly have music playing in my headphones, and I play piano and flute. I'm excited to express my interests through my assignments for this class and improve my persuasion skills by working with various modes along with writing.</p>
												
												<p>My daily ritual to clear my mind is taking a one or two hour nap after I finish my classes or day's work. It helps me release the stress of receiving an abundance of information and prepares me to study and do homework.</p>
												
												<p>Thank you for reading this introduction. I'm eager to get to know everyone in this class better!</p>

											<h3>Meeting Manoj Sarathy</h3>
										</header>
										<p>Hi Manoj!</p>
										<p>We're both CS majors, so we might encounter each other in other classes or activities.</p>
										<p>I've been to Bellevue just a few times, but I remember that it's a beautiful city. Also, what are your favorite places to eat and have fun in Seattle?</p>
										<p>I'm definitely interested in making a group to keep track of assignments since I'm prone to forget things quickly. Hopefully, we can gather a few more people and create a Discord server for this class. We could also do chess as a bonding activity.</p>
										<p>Thank you for sharing your daily ritual, for it does sound very effective in relieving stress, which is especially important during these times.</p>
										<p>I had a good laugh at your camping story! It must've been pretty frightening during the moment, though, so I'm glad that the missing person ended up uninjured. You're a great storyteller; I'd love to hear more of your stories in the future.</p>
										<p>Nice to meet you!</p>

											<h3>Meeting Jaden Wang</h3>
										</header>
										<p>Hi Jaden!</p>
										<p>Since you live near UW, would you say you're pretty familiar with the Seattle-area? If so, what're your favorite places to visit for recreational or relaxation purposes?</p>
										<p>Doing a double degree in CS and Music Education is super unique! I believe you're taking CSE 143 right now, and for that class, there's an interesting homework assignment called GuitarHero that intertwines some music knowledge with programming. I'm sure you'll have tons of fun with that assignment, and you might hopefully get some inspiration for how you can combine the two majors in the future. </p>
										<p>Have you ever watched TwoSetViolin on Youtube? They do funny videos related to the violin, orchestra, and other instruments, and I think they've also done some skits about playing the orchestra pit.</p>
										<p>Your hobbies were super interesting to read! I just learned about quilling and flipping butterfly knives, so thank you for teaching me a couple of new things today. </p>
										<p>Nice to meet you!</p>

											<h3>Meeting Wendy Bui</h3>
										</header>
										<p>Hi Wendy!</p>
										<p>What dorm are you currently at, and what kind of review would you give it?</p>
										<p>We have pretty similar goals for college, especially exploring different career paths and avoiding burn out. It'd be awesome to stay in contact to help each other pursue our goals! </p>
										<p>Studying foreign languages is an impressive fact! I've recently gotten into studying Chinese and Japanese, and I discovered that languages are not easy at all, so major props to you for picking up 5 languages. What 5 do you know? If Chinese or Japanese is one of them, we could help each other out.</p>
										<p>I don't have any similar classes as you besides ENGL 182, but I took ECON 200 during the Summer Quarter and remember some information from that class, so if you ever need help with that class, feel free to reach out!</p>
										<p>Nice to met you!</p>
