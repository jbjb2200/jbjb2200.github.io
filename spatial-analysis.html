													<h4>Transcript</h4>
												</header>
												<p>Hello everyone! Welcome to my house.</p>
												<p>Down this hallway here is my favorite room in my entire house. And it’s the living room. Tadah! So as you can see, the entrance to the living room is very open to the rest of the house, giving the room a large spacious feeling, which is perfect because this is a room that’s for my family to gather and collect and it helps that the center of the room is very open with the furniture and other items framing the wide-spread rug. And I spend a lot of time here creating memories with my family on weekend days, Friday movie nights, or Christmas days. </p>
												<p>And here is where my father would sit. And right next to him is where I sit. I sit on this very comfortable movie couch, and in this room, I have complete freedom. I can choose what movie I want to watch. I can choose if I want to lay down, or if I want to sleep. Then that’s part of the reason why I love this room so much. I can do whatever I want--whatever to do to relax. And right next to me is where my mother sits. And this seating arrangement was completely unplanned but it feels completely comfortable that my father and mother are on both sides of me.</p>
												<p>And this balance translates into the entire room too. There’s a symmetric feeling to the room with the chairs and sofa on one side, and then, in a completely 180 turn we have entertainment on the other side. So we have a bookshelf and a TV on the completely other side. So seating on one side, and entertainment on the other. But there is some bit of tension, a bit of contrast, to make the room a bit interesting. There’s dark furniture all over this room, but on a sunny day this large window pours light into the entire house and it makes a lot of sense that the more family-centric room in the house would contain the room that brings the most light. With this large window, many people would expect that the temperature in this room varies quite a bit, but actually our house is very insulated so this room is pretty cool. So in summer time, that gives another reason for why my family gathers here.</p>
												<p>Another bit of interesting characteristic of this room is the asymmetrical layout of the entertainment wall. So instead of having the TV in the center, it’s off to the side, and all the items on the bookshelf help balance out the TV. And this bookshelf right here is another indication of all the memories that this room holds. So there’s no plan to these bookshelves on how we lay it out, but it contains a bunch of miscellaneous items with nostalgic factor and memories attached to them. So the flower picture is a picture that I took in a photography class and gave to my mother. And these memories also bring color into this room. You can see the pinks and purples. And they stand out, so when we sit down on the chairs, we recognize all the memories that this bookshelf contains. </p>
												<p>And then not only does this room unify our memories and experiences but it also unifies my family's culture--the diverse culture that my family has. So my mother is from China, so she brought some of her chinese paintings here. Here is another one over here. </p>
												<p>And this room is just completely calming. I have total freedom and when we’re silent doing our--when my family is silent and doing their own things, we can listen to Studio Ghibli music, or we could listen to the steady rhythm of the ticking clock. And so this room is my favorite room for all the memories here and family gatherings here. And I hope you gained a nice idea of what my living room is like and its spatial design. Thank you for watching!
