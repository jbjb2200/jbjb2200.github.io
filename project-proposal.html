													<h3>Project Proposal</h3>
												</header>
												<p>Yesterday, after spending hours stressing over a problem in my computer science homework, I opened up a tab on my computer and typed in Discord. On the instant messaging site, I was able to interact with my study group and obtain answers to my questions. I can tell a similar story to this one for the majority of my classes in the Summer and Autumn Quarter. Despite being originally created for the gaming community and not for school, Discord has helped me easily connect with my classmates in a virtual school environment in ways that are impossible to replicate with only e-mails or Zoom private messaging. Observing how smoothly students integrated Discord into school life--with some instructors creating their own Discord chats for their classes or promoting already created chats--I began wondering how other social media platforms that are not specifically targeted to schools could be used for educational purposes, and if there would be more benefits than costs. To address my curiosity, I formed a question: to what extent should social media be integrated into American high school and college education and for what purpose? Increasingly more social media use should be implemented in American high school and college classrooms as communication tools and ways to present information while respecting boundaries set by individuals and the State Legislatures. Social media in education leads to an improvement in communication leads to more comfortable relationships between students and the instructor, students can access to more perspectives on a topic, and education could be seen as entertainment. 
												</p>

												<p>Since I am arguing for more use of social media in the classroom, my audience is school board members, instructors, and students doubtful about the benefits that I claim exist in my thesis. My audience includes all school board members because I must convince all of them to support my argument for changes in the school system to occur. Due to being more familiar with how the American school system functions, I limited the scope to schools in this country. Additionally, in my point of view, students in middle and elementary school are too young to have education integrated with social media, hence the age bracket I chose. I believe that discussing this topic is important, for many students were taught for years that social media is terrible for our mental health and only further isolates people. Older school board members and instructors particularly carry a stigma against social media, considering how they grew up surrounded by books, shows, and other forms of media predicting the destruction brought upon society by technology and social media in the future. However, people must realize that social media is here to stay with no intention of ever leaving, so we should find a way of taking advantage of the best features of social media to elevate the classroom setting rather than completely banning it. The source by Wang Qingya especially helps reinforce this reasoning, for the source discusses how social media is already integrated in college students’ lives. Students would benefit the most from a shift in attitude towards social media because instead of being shamed for using it, they would learn how to utilize it and other resources around them for elevating their learning. 
												</p> 
												<p>Even if there are several benefits involving social media in school, there are also several valid oppositions to my thesis. What students were taught about social media was not untrue at all, and social media does significantly contribute to mental health issues and distracts several students from doing their schoolwork. Instructors and school board members would point to these issues in resistance to my stance. An accessibility problem exists as well, for not all students own a device, use social media, or feel comfortable revealing personal information through their accounts, which would raise some resistance to my argument from fellow students. I plan to take a reasonable approach to the potential opposition by including the contrasting perspectives on social media use in education in my open letter and introducing feasible solutions and analyzing the opposition in a way to strengthen my own argument. A source that would help me address opposition is by Alison Purvis, for Purvis brings up drawbacks to social media, but then explains how each point is not as disadvantageous as initially assumed.</p>
												<p>As mentioned recently, I plan to construct my argument in an open, blog-like letter because my core audience will be school board members who have the most power in making decisions, but my letter can still circulate to fellow students. I would most effectively convey my message through a formal format with clear supporting evidence, while adding colors and pictures to make my letter attractive enough for my classmates to feel drawn to read. In my letter, I want to initially define what the term “social media” means and what platforms it includes, for there is concrete or unanimous meaning of the term. To me, social media is any interactive site intended for sharing information and participating in communities with no limitations on its audience. To respect the set page length for the project, though, I aim to focus on the big players like Twitter and Facebook. To elaborate a bit more on my definition of “social media,” I plan to use (Gupta) because this source discusses the biggest social media platforms and their intentions. Next, I plan to read research papers and consume non-traditional resources regarding the use of social media for learning in higher education, noting the advantages and disadvantages mentioned. I hope to find statistics and anecdotal evidence to support my essay. (Nantais) has mostly positive reports from teachers who implemented social media in classrooms, so quoting teachers’ responses to the new change would help my case. (Morris) offers up several options for how social media can further learning, such as using social media to easily ask conceptual questions about tricky problems on assignments. Afterwards, I will address the downsides of tying social media and education together, brainstorm possible solutions, and search for research that would enforce my ideas. Finally, I will end the essay by discussing how this topic connects to how the school system in the future will react to even newer technologies that are not originally intended for education materializing.</p>
