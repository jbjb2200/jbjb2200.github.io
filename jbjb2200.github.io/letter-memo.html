													<h3>Cultural Artifact Letter - Composer's Memo</h3>
												</header>
												<p>My artifact is a symbol from the album <em>Love Yourself: Answer</em> by the Korean boy band group BTS. I chose the symbol instead of the album because I believe that the symbol better represents the entire Love Yourself era. For this assignment, I immediately knew that I wanted to talk about the community related to BTS because I have about four years of experience as a follower of the boy group and read plenty of unfounded insults targeting the fans and group. In my first year of high school, I met one of my closest friends after she introduced me to BTS, and since then, I created several fond memories with the community of other fans. I decided to select the heart symbol in particular because I once conversed with a fellow BTS fan during a Knowledge Bowl competition after recognizing the symbol on her sweater, which demonstrates how distinguishable the symbol is for supporters of BTS. 
												</p>

												<p>My target audience for the letter is adversaries who treat BTS and their fans disrespectfully or dismiss the group for making music in a different language. To effectively communicate to such an audience, I presented the letter in the form of a Twitter thread. I wanted a format where most people would read on a daily basis, so I knew that a formal essay would not work as well as a social media post. Despite not doing a standard essay, I still chose to write formally because many people actively mock the fans of BTS for being ill-educated young children. On Twitter, messages can easily go viral due to the retweet feature, allowing my letter to reach more of my audience. I can also include pictures and links to further elaborate on certain topics or prove my points in ways that just text cannot. Additionally, Twitter is the perfect intersection between people supporting various celebrities, shows, and movies and people supporting more mainstream topics or using the app for personal reasons. I know more BTS related accounts with huge followings, so I tried including more hashtags and usernames related to the group to easily gain support from other BTS fans. I chose hashtags specifically related to BTSâ€™s album coming out in a couple of weeks and a music competition the group is in, for most people would be visiting and using those hashtags. Fellow BTS  fans will contribute to sharing the thread, so I can then reach out to my intended audience.</p>
